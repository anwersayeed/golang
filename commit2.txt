################### Building a CRUD application:- without database (using trucks and slices to perform operations)

--- Commands
- go build 
- go run main.go 

- Used gorilla mux library

--- Routes (POSTMAN)  -method-    -route-
- GET     --> getAll  getMovies   /movies
- GET     --> getById getMovie    /movies/id
- POST    --> create  createMovie /movies
- PUT     --> update  updateMovie /movies/id
- DELETE  --> delete  deleteMovie /movies/id

- go get "github.com/gorilla/mux"

- we will not have :- routes, models, controllers, database

- Works fine
- For post request, you can send like below, chosing raw inside Body in postman 
{
    "id": "1",
    "isbn": "345678",
    "title": "A good Disnosour",
    "director": {
        "firstname": "Kritter",
        "lastname": "Spot"
    }
}
